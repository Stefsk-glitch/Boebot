# BoeBot
The Boe-Bot is a good first robot for junior high, high school, and community college courses. For many years it has been used in classroom and regional competitions. 

Our use of the Boebot: bluetooth application, object detection (LEDs turn red & buzzer starts buzzin' when object detected), infra-red (w/ a remote) and a claw to take and drop an object.
